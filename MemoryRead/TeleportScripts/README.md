# Teleport Scripts
A collection of AHK scripts used for teleporting around in games. Requires classMemory.ahk to be present in the same directory as the script.

## Usage
Generally the hotkeys go as follows:
- F1 - Save position 1
- F2 - Save position 2
- F3 - Load position 1
- F4 - Load position 2

However there may be exceptions where saving more than 2 positions is useful or saving positions isn't useful at all. When those arise, the scripts that don't follow the above hotkey layout will be listed below.
