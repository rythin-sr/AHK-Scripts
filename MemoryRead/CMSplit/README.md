# CMSplit
A script I made partially to learn about memory reading in AHK, as well as deal with inconsistency with LiveSplit's memory reading that seems to have issues reading Crazy Machines' memory.

A side effect of doing this is the ability to use splitting programs such as WSplit, which normally don't support autosplitting, for running the game.

# Usage
Have the split program of your choice running, bind Start/Split to **Numpad0** and Reset to **Numpad4**
