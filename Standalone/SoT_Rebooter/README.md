# Sands of Time Rebooter
A quick script I made for my own use in Sands of Time speedruns, as the existing SoT Killer app didn't quite work how I wanted it to.

Pressing up arrow will close the game if it was running, then start it again (assuming your install is at D:\Steam\...) and click away the Safe Mode prompt automatically.
