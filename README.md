# AHK-Scripts
A collection of my autohotkey scripts.

These are separated into two directories:
 - Standalone - these scripts can be ran by themselves and work fine
 - MemoryRead - these scripts require [classMemory by Kalamity](https://github.com/Kalamity/classMemory) in the same directory as the script in order to work properly
